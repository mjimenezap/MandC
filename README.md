### Solar Panel Project

This is the final project for the Advanced Electronics class at ICAI. We implement a PI control in C to keep the solar panel orientation aligned with the sun. The sunlight is processed via hardware (using an amplification circuit based on Op-Amps), and the code has been callibrated using MATLAB and in-lab measurements.
